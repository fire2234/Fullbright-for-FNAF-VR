# TUTORIAL FOR ALTERNATIVE FULLBRIGHT ( VANILLA FULLBRIGHT) :
Download this :
# https://framedsc.github.io/GeneralGuides/universal_ue4_consoleunlocker.htm
Set up as instructed on the website, then 
when you reach the point of marking the  `" Input.ini "` set the desired keybind before you set it as readonly
edit the file called `" Engine.ini "`
paste this

 >[/Script/Engine.RendererSettings]                                                              
 >r.ForceDebugViewModes=1

Save and run the game ( no need to set Engine.ini  as readonly )

Start the unlocker after you opened the game, it will do it's thing, and then you should see another window pop out, that will confirm the unlocker has done its's job, press the keybind allocated to make the console show up, then type this command :

# viewmode unlit

This makes the whole game visible, same effects as 3Dmigoto, but this affects all the missing textures in 3DMigoto shader patches, and they show up precisely! 

To remove fullbright, just type

# viewmode lit

This will restore the game view as normal.
