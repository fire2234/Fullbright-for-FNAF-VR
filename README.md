# TUTORIAL FOR ALTERNATIVE FULLBRIGHT ( VANILLA FULLBRIGHT) :
Download this :
# https://framedsc.github.io/GeneralGuides/universal_ue4_consoleunlocker.htm
Set up as instructed on the website, then 
when you reach the point of marking the  " Input.ini " as readonly
edit the file called " Engine.ini "
paste this

# [/Script/Engine.RendererSettings]
# r.ForceDebugViewModes=1

And save, then run the game ( no need to set Engine.ini  as readonly )

After you unlocked the console, it should show up  after you press the keybind you set with the instruction given in the unlocker.
it should show the console, type this command

# viewmode unlit
This makes the whole game visible, same effects as 3Dmigoto, but this affects all the missing textures in 3DMigoto shader patches, and they show up precisely! 

To remove fullbright, just type

# viewmode lit

This will restore the game view as normal.
