# https://framedsc.github.io/GeneralGuides/universal_ue4_consoleunlocker.htm#downloading-the-uuu

go in this folder : %localappdata%\freddys\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor\
Edit the file called `" Engine.ini "`
paste this at the end .

    [/Script/Engine.RendererSettings]                                                              
    r.ForceDebugViewModes=1

Save and run the game ( no need to set Engine.ini  as readonly )

Start the unlocker after you opened the game, it will do it's thing, and then you should see another window pop out, that will confirm the unlocker has done its's job, press the keybind allocated to make the console show up.

# IF CONSOLE DOESNT SHOW UP, CHANGE KEYBINDS IN THE UNLOCKER.

type this command :

# viewmode unlit

This makes the whole game visible, same effects as 3Dmigoto Old Fullbright., but this affects all the missing textures in 3DMigoto shader patches, and they show up precisely! 

To remove fullbright, just type

# viewmode lit

This will restore the game view as normal.

This Mod provides Fullbright using Unreal Engine Console .
